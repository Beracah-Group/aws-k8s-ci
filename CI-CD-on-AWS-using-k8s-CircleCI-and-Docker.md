# CI/CD on AWS using Kubernetes, CircleCI andÂ Docker


## Introduction

This article aims at providing a step by step guide of creating a CI/CD pipeline in AWS, using CircleCI, Kubernetes and Docker.

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration tool, used to build, test and deploy applications easier and faster.

[Kubernetes(k8s)](https://kubernetes.io/), is an orchestration that is used in managing containerized workloads and services.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), is a tool that is used to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

*Note*: I'll that assume you have basic understanding of the above tools. I won't go into depth explaining what each tool is.

## Outline
1. AWS Setup
2. Kubernetes on AWS
3. Docker registry
4. CircleCI
5. Testing

### AWS Setup
If you don't have an AWS account, you can create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), and make use of the free tier services. I'm going to use a free tier account through out this tutorial.

Next, create an IAM user, who will be used for doing various administrative roles. We're going to create this user using the console. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**, then click on the **Add User** button. Select **Programmatic access** option, and remember to download the access keys for later reference.

Grant the user the following permissions:

```
AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonRoute53FullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
AmazonVPCFullAccess
```

Next, we are going to configure AWS using the CLI. So, install the CLI:

OSX - `brew install awscli`

Linux - `pip install awscli --upgrade --user`

Windows - Refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-windows.html)

If all went well in the above installlation steps, let us now configure the AWS CLI. You need to provide the Access Key, Secret Access Key and the AWS region that you want the K8s cluster to be installed. 

Run `aws configure`

Fill in the right credentials:

```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AccessKeyValue
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: SecretAccessKeyValue
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]:
```

To provision Kubernetes, we'll use kops, which expects an s3 bucket to persist its state. So, lets create the bucket:

```
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket awsk8s --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2

```
Then enable the versioning of the bucket, by running the following command:

``` 
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket awsk8s --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```
